<h3 align="center">E-commerce Online Shopping</h3>



---

<p align="center"> The E-commerce Online Shopping Project is a web application developed using React JS, Spring Boot, and MySQL. It aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for online shopping. The front-end is built with React JS, ensuring a responsive and interactive user interface. The back-end is powered by Spring Boot, which handles the business logic, data processing, and API integrations. The MySQL database stores product information, user details, and order data, ensuring secure and reliable data storage.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
In this project, all the main functionalities have been which should be present in any Ecommerce Project or Online Shopping Project. 

When a user visits our application for the first time, he will be able to see all the Products on the Home Page by default, he can also search the products based on the product categories which was added by the Administrator. After that User can log in and add the products to the Cart, and he can add multiple products to Cart with his required quantity, User can also delete the product from the Cart at any time.  

After this, the User can Order the products which are present in his Cart. During the Order placing, the User will be redirected to the Dummy Payment Page for the Order Payment. After the payment, all the products which were present in the Cart will be Ordered and he will get Order Id for the reference, And now he can also see his Orders, Delivery Person Details, and Delivery Status.

After the Customer Orders, Admin can all the Orders made by All the Customers. And now,  Admin can assign a Delivery Person for the Order by using the Customer Order Id. Now, After Assigning the Delivery Person, that particular Customer will be able to see the assigned Delivery Person who will deliver his Orders. And this Delivery Person will update the customer's Order Delivery Status like at what date and time the order is expected to deliver.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

BACKEND PART  :- 
```
  
<h3> STEP 1 :- Import the backend part of project to sts</h3>

- Launch Spring Tool Suite.
- In the main menu, click on "File" and select "Import" to open the import wizard.
- In the import wizard, expand the "Maven" category and select "Existing Maven Projects". Click "Next".
- On the next screen, click the "Browse" button next to the "Root Directory" field and navigate to the location of your Maven project.
- Select the project folder and click "Finish". STS will start scanning the project directory for the Maven project structure and dependencies.
- Once the project is detected, you will see it listed in the import wizard. Make sure the project checkbox is selected, and click "Finish".
- STS will import the Maven project and start building it. This process may take some time.

<h3>STEP 2 :- Open application.properties file </h3>

- Write your root password after equals on the line : ```spring.datasource.password = ```
- Create a images folder in the system .
- Give the correct path of the images folder under : ```disk.uplaod.basepath = ```
  
<h3>STEP 3 :- Run Mavin Build</h3>

- Click on the project .
- Select run as maven build
- In the goals write : clean install
- Check the skip test box 
- Click on apply 
- The console will open and it will run the tests and after completion it will show  'BHUILD SUCCESS'

<h4>STEP 3 :- Run the Project </h3>

- Click on the Project 
- Select run as Spring Boot App

<hr>

```
FRONT-END PART  :-
```

<h3> STEP 1 :- Import the front-end part of project to vs code </h3>

- Launch Visual Studio Code.
- Open the folder where your existing React project is located by either selecting "Open Folder" from the "File" menu or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K Ctrl+O (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+K - Cmd+O (macOS).
- Once the folder is open in VS Code, you should see the project files in the Explorer sidebar.
- Open an integrated terminal in VS Code by selecting "View" from the menu, then "Terminal" or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+ backtick (`). This will open a new terminal pane at the bottom of the editor.
- In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of your React project.
- Once you're in the root directory of your React project and have Node.js and npm installed, run the following command to install the project dependencies listed in the package.json file:```npm install```

<h3> STEP 2 :- Run the Project  </h3>

- After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the React development server:```npm start```
- Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:3000). You should now see your React application running in the browser.
- 
```
NOTE:- Initially the admin need to add products and category as shown in modules section of the readme . 
```


## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

<h2> STEP 1 :- Set up the Live System:</h2>

- Obtain a server or hosting provider where you can deploy your project.
- Ensure the server meets the system requirements for running React JS, Spring Boot, and MySQL.
- Install the necessary software dependencies on the server, including Node.js, Java (for Spring Boot), and MySQL.

<h2>STEP 2 :- Build the React JS Frontend:</h2>

- In the root directory of your React project, run the following command to build the optimized production-ready version of your frontend:```npm run build```
- This will create a build folder containing the compiled and minified assets of your React project.

<h2> STEP 3 :-Configure and Serve the Frontend (React JS):</h2>

- Set up a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) on the server to serve the static files of your React JS frontend.
- Configure the web server to point to the build folder generated in Step 2.
- Set up appropriate routing rules and configurations to handle frontend routes.

<h2>STEP 4 :-Test and Verify the Deployment:</h2>

- Access the live system URL in a web browser to ensure that the React JS frontend and Spring Boot backend are functioning correctly.
- Perform end-to-end testing on the live system to validate the complete functionality of the E-commerce Online Shopping Project.
- Monitor the logs and error reports to identify and resolve any issues that may arise during the live deployment.

<h2>STEP 5 :-Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) (Optional):</h2>

- Consider implementing CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD to automate the deployment process, allowing for continuous integration and deployment of updates to the live system.
